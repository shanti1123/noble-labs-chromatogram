# Chromatogram Plotting Code Tester

This Python script will loads LC-MS/MS chromatogram data from a `.tsv` file, filters transitions by the relative intensity, and then plot them over time using matplotlib.

## Files
- `chromatogram.py`: This is the main script
- `data.tsv`: Tab-separated data file with Retention Time and Intensity columns

## How to Run in VS Code
Terminal command: cd - file path on computer - python chromatogram.py
